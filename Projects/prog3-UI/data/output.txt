 Item 1. Business
 Company Overview
 We are a Canadian corporation that serves as the indirect holding company for Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs and their consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the world’s largest quick service restaurant (“QSR”) companies with over $35 billion in annual system-wide sales and approximately 30,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries as of December 31, 2022. Our Tim Hortons®, Burger King®, Popeyes® and Firehouse Subs® brands have similar franchise business models with complementary daypart mixes and product platforms. Our four iconic brands are managed independently while benefiting from global scale and sharing of best practices. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 100% of total restaurants for each of our brands was franchised and references to "our restaurants" or "system-wide restaurants" include franchised restaurants and those owned by us ("Company restaurants").
 Our business generates revenues from the following sources: (i) sales, consisting primarily of supply chain sales, which represent sales of products, supplies and restaurant equipment to franchisees, as well as sales to retailers and sales at Company restaurants; (ii) franchise revenues, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchise restaurants and franchise fees paid by franchisees; (iii) property revenues from properties we lease or sublease to franchisees; and (iv) advertising revenues and other services, consisting primarily of advertising fund contributions based on a percentage of sales reported by franchise restaurants.
 Our Tim Hortons® Brand
 Founded in 1964, TH is one of the largest donut/coffee/tea restaurant chains in North America and the largest in Canada as measured by total number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or franchised a total of 5,600 TH restaurants. TH restaurants are quick service restaurants with a menu that includes premium blend coffee, tea, espresso-based hot and cold specialty drinks, fresh baked goods, including donuts, Timbits®, bagels, muffins, cookies and pastries, grilled paninis, classic sandwiches, wraps, soups and more.
 Our Burger King® Brand
 Founded in 1954, Burger King (“BK”) is the world’s second largest fast food hamburger restaurant chain as measured by total number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or franchised a total of 19,789 BK restaurants in more than 100 countries. BK restaurants are quick service restaurants that feature flame-grilled hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, soft drinks and other food items.
 Our Popeyes® Brand
 Founded in 1972, Popeyes (“PLK”) is the world’s second largest quick service chicken concept as measured by total number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or franchised a total of 4,091 PLK restaurants. PLK restaurants are quick service restaurants that distinguish themselves with a unique “Louisiana” style menu featuring fried chicken, chicken tenders, fried shrimp and other seafood, red beans and rice and other regional items.
 Our Firehouse Subs® Brand
 Founded in 1994, Firehouse Subs (“FHS”) is a brand built on decades of culture rooted in public service and a leading player in the QSR sandwich category in North America. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or franchised a total of 1,242 FHS restaurants. FHS restaurants are quick service restaurants featuring hot and hearty subs piled high with quality meats and cheese as well as chopped salads, chili and soups, signature and other sides, soft drinks and local specialties.
 Our Business Strategy
 We believe that we have created a financially strong company built upon a foundation of four thriving, independent brands with significant global growth potential and the opportunity to be one of the most efficient franchised QSR operators in the world through our focus on the following strategies:
  
 •accelerating net restaurant growth;
 •enhancing guest service and experience at our restaurants through comprehensive training, improved restaurant operations, reimaged restaurants and appealing menu options;
 •increasing restaurant sales and profitability which are critical to the success of our franchise partners and our ability to grow our brands around the world;

 •strengthening drive thru and delivery channels to provide guests convenient access to our product offerings;
 •utilizing technological and digital initiatives, including loyalty programs, to interact with our guests and modernize the operations of our restaurants;
 •efficiently managing costs and sharing best practices; and
 •preserving the rich heritage of each of our brands by managing them and their respective franchisee relationships independently and continuing to play a prominent role in local communities.
 Operating Segments
 Our business consists of four operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (1) TH; (2) BK; (3) PLK; and (4) FHS. Additional financial information about our reportable segments can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 18, “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 Restaurant Development
 As part of our development approach for our brands in the U.S., we have granted limited development rights in specific areas to franchisees in connection with area development agreements. We expect to enter into similar arrangements in 2023 and beyond. In Canada, we have not granted exclusive or protected areas to BK or TH franchisees, with limited exceptions.
 As part of our international growth strategy for our BK, TH and PLK brands, we have established master franchise and development agreements in a number of markets, and we expect to enter into similar arrangements for FHS. We have also created strategic master franchise joint ventures in which we received a meaningful minority equity stake in each joint venture. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate international development of all of our brands, including through the establishment of master franchises with exclusive development rights and joint ventures with new and existing franchisees.
 Advertising and Promotions
 In general, franchisees fund substantially all of the marketing programs for each of our brands by making contributions ranging from 2.0% to 5.0% of gross sales to advertising funds managed by us or by the franchisees. Advertising contributions are used to pay for expenses relating to marketing, advertising and promotion, including market research, production, advertising costs, sales promotions, social media campaigns, technology initiatives and other support functions for the respective brands. In 2021, we spent C$80 million to support TH Canada advertising expenses and in September 2022, we announced our intention to pay $120 million of BK US advertising expenses over approximately two years.
 We manage the advertising funds for each of our brands in the U.S. and Canada. While we manage the advertising funds in select markets for BK and PLK, in most international markets, including the markets managed by master franchisees, franchisees make contributions into franchisee-managed advertising funds. As part of our global marketing strategy, we provide franchisees with advertising support and guidance in order to deliver a consistent global brand message.
 Product Development
 New product development is a key driver of the long-term success of our brands. We believe the development of new products can drive traffic by expanding our customer base, allowing restaurants to expand into new dayparts, and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste. Based on guest feedback, we drive product innovation in order to satisfy the needs of our guests around the world. This strategy will continue to be a focus in 2023 and beyond.
 Operations Support
 Our operations strategy is designed to deliver best-in-class restaurant operations by our franchisees and to improve friendliness, cleanliness, speed of service and overall guest satisfaction. Each of our brands has uniform operating standards and specifications relating to product quality, cleanliness and maintenance of the premises. In addition, our restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with quality assurance and health standards that each brand has established, as well as standards set by applicable governmental laws and regulations, including applicable local, provincial and state laws regarding COVID-19 and applicable health authority guidelines. Each franchisee typically participates in initial and ongoing training programs to learn all aspects of operating a restaurant in accordance with each brand’s operating standards.
 Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution
 In general, we approve the manufacturers of the food, packaging, equipment and other products used in restaurants for each of our brands. We have a comprehensive supplier approval process, which requires all food and packaging products to pass our quality standards and the suppliers’ manufacturing process and facilities to pass on-site food safety inspections. Our franchisees are required to purchase substantially all food and other products from approved suppliers and distributors.

 TH products are sourced from a combination of third-party suppliers and our own manufacturing facilities. To protect our proprietary blends, we operate two coffee roasting facilities in Ancaster, Ontario and Rochester, New York, where we roast the majority of the coffee for our TH restaurants and blend the beans for our take home, packaged coffee. Our fondant and fills manufacturing facility in Oakville, Ontario produces, and is the primary supplier of, the ready-to-use glaze, fondants, fills and syrups which are used in a number of TH products in North America. As of December 31, 2022, we typically have only one or a few suppliers to service each category of products sold at our restaurants.
 We sell most raw materials and supplies, including coffee, sugar, paper goods and other restaurant supplies, to TH restaurants in Canada and the U.S. We purchase those raw materials from multiple suppliers and generally have alternative sources of supply for each. While we have multiple suppliers for coffee from various coffee-producing regions, the available supply and price for high-quality coffee beans can fluctuate dramatically. Accordingly, we monitor world market conditions for green (unroasted) coffee and contract for future supply volumes to obtain expected requirements of high-quality coffee beans at acceptable prices.
 Our TH business has significant supply chain operations, including procurement, warehousing and distribution, to supply paper, dry goods, frozen goods and refrigerated products to a substantial majority of our Canadian restaurants. We act as a distributor to TH restaurants in Canada through nine distribution centers located in Canada, of which five are company-owned. We own or lease a significant number of trucks and trailers that regularly deliver to most of our Canadian restaurants. In the U.S., we supply similar products to restaurants through third-party distributors.
 All of the products used in our BK, PLK and FHS restaurants are sourced from third-party suppliers. In the U.S. and Canada, there is a purchasing cooperative for each of BK and PLK that negotiates the purchase terms for most equipment, food, beverages (other than branded soft drinks which we negotiate separately under long-term agreements) and other products used in BK and PLK restaurants. The purchasing agent is also authorized to purchase and manage distribution services on behalf of most of the BK and PLK restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. PLK also utilizes exclusive suppliers for certain of its proprietary products. As of December 31, 2022, four distributors serviced approximately 92% of BK restaurants in the U.S., five distributors serviced approximately 85% of PLK restaurants in the U.S. and five distributors serviced approximately 100% of the FHS restaurants in the U.S. Additionally, some suppliers pay us rebates based on items purchased by franchisees.
 In 2000, Burger King entered into long-term exclusive contracts with The Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper/Snapple, Inc. to supply BK restaurants with their products and which obligate restaurants in the U.S. to purchase a specified number of gallons of soft drink syrup. These volume commitments are not subject to any time limit. As of December 31, 2022, we estimate that it will take approximately 5.1 years to complete the Coca-Cola purchase commitment and approximately 8.8 years to complete the Dr Pepper/Snapple, Inc. purchase commitment. If these agreements were terminated, we would be obligated to pay an aggregate amount equal to approximately $268 million as of December 31, 2022 based on an amount per gallon for each gallon of soft drink syrup remaining in the purchase commitments, interest and certain other costs. We have also entered into long-term beverage supply arrangements with certain major beverage vendors for the TH, PLK and FHS brands in the U.S. and Canada.
 Franchise Agreements and Other Arrangements
 General. We grant franchisees the right to operate restaurants using our trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property, uniform operating procedures, consistent quality of products and services and standard procedures for inventory control and management. For each franchise restaurant, we generally enter into a franchise agreement covering a standard set of terms and conditions. Recurring fees consist of periodic royalty and advertising payments. Franchisees report gross sales on a monthly or weekly basis and pay royalties based on gross sales.
 Franchise agreements are generally not assignable without our consent. In Canada and the U.S., our TH franchise agreements grant us the right to reacquire a restaurant under certain circumstances, and our BK, PLK and FHS franchise agreements generally provide us a right of first refusal if a franchisee proposes to sell a restaurant. Defaults (including non-payment of royalties or advertising contributions, or failure to operate in compliance with our standards) can lead to termination of the franchise agreement.
 U.S. and Canada. TH franchisees in the U.S. and Canada operate under several types of license agreements, with a typical term for a standard restaurant of 10 years plus renewal period(s) of 10 years in the aggregate for Canada and a typical term of 20 years for the U.S. TH franchisees who lease land and/or buildings from us typically pay a royalty of 3.0% to 4.5% of weekly restaurant gross sales. Our license agreements contemplate a one-time franchise fee which must be paid in full before the restaurant opens for business and upon the grant of an additional term. Under a separate lease or sublease, TH franchisees typically pay monthly rent based on the greater of a fixed monthly payment and contingent rental payments based on a percentage (usually 8.5% to 10.0%) of monthly gross sales or flow through monthly rent based on the terms of an underlying lease. Where the franchisee owns the premises, leases it from a third party or enters into a flow through lease with TH, the royalty is typically increased. In addition, the royalty rates under license agreements entered into in connection with non-standard restaurants, including self-serve kiosks and strategic alliances with third parties, may vary from those described above and are negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

 Table of Contents
 The typical BK and PLK franchise agreement in the U.S. and Canada has a 20-year term and the typical FHS agreement has a 10-year term, all of which contemplate a one-time franchise fee plus an additional fee upon renewal. Subject to the incentive programs described below, most new BK franchise restaurants in the U.S. and Canada pay a royalty on gross sales of 4.5%, most PLK restaurants in the U.S. and Canada pay a royalty on gross sales of 5.0% and most FHS restaurants in the U.S and Canada pay a royalty on gross sales of 6.0%. BK franchise agreements typically provide for a 20-year renewal term, PLK franchise agreements typically provide for two 10-year renewal terms and FHS franchise agreements typically provide for four 5-year renewal terms. In addition, BK and PLK franchisees pay a technology fee on all digital sales through our proprietary technology and FHS franchisees pay an annual per restaurant information system fee.
 In an effort to improve the image of our BK restaurants in the U.S., we offered U.S. franchisees matching funds with respect to certain restaurant upgrades and remodels. These franchisees can elect to pay an increased royalty rate in order to receive a higher level of matching funds. We plan to continue to offer remodel incentives to U.S. franchisees during 2023. These limited-term incentive programs are expected to negatively impact our cash flow in the early years while in effect but increase the royalty rate for a period following the remodel. However, we expect this impact to be partially mitigated as incentive programs granted in prior years that provided reductions to royalty and advertising rates expire. For PLK, we offer development incentive programs pursuant to which we encourage veterans, women or minorities to become PLK franchisees and develop and open new restaurants. For FHS, we offer limited-term royalty reductions in connection with commitments to develop additional restaurants in specified territories.
 International. As part of the international growth strategy for each of our brands, we have entered into master franchise agreements or development agreements that grant franchisees exclusive or non-exclusive development rights and, in some cases, allow them to sub-franchise or require them to provide support services to other franchisees in their markets. In 2022, we entered into master franchise agreements for the PLK brand in Indonesia, New Zealand, Poland, the Czech Republic and Taiwan, for the BK brand in Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania, and for the TH brand in Pakistan, and development agreements for the PLK brand in Singapore, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Kazakhstan and Honduras. The franchise fees, royalty rate and advertising contributions paid by master franchisees or developers vary from country to country, depending on the facts and circumstances of each market. We expect to continue implementing similar arrangements for our brands in 2023 and beyond.
 Franchise Restaurant Leases. We leased or subleased 3,531 properties to TH franchisees, 1,364 properties to BK franchisees, and 83 properties to PLK franchisees as of December 31, 2022 pursuant to separate lease agreements with these franchisees. For properties that we lease from third-party landlords and sublease to franchisees, our leases generally provide for fixed rental payments and may provide for contingent rental payments based on a restaurant’s annual gross sales. Franchisees who lease land only or land and building from us do so on a “triple net” basis. Under these triple net leases, the franchisee is obligated to pay all costs and expenses, including all real property taxes and assessments, repairs and maintenance and insurance. In many cases, we will contribute toward the cost of remodels with the franchisees in connection with extensions of the underlying lease.
 Intellectual Property
 We own valuable intellectual property relating to our brands, including trademarks, service marks, patents, industrial designs, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information, some of which are of material importance to our TH, BK, PLK and FHS businesses. The duration of trademarks and service marks varies by country, however, trademarks and service marks generally are valid and may be renewed as long as they are in use and/or properly registered. We have established the standards and specifications for most of the goods and services used in the development, improvement and operation of our restaurants. These proprietary standards, specifications and restaurant operating procedures are our trade secrets. Additionally, we own certain patents and industrial designs of varying duration relating to equipment and/or packaging used in BK and TH restaurants.
 Information Systems and Digital Technology
 Our corporate financial, human resources and similar systems are fully integrated and provide a solid foundation for our business. We began providing rPOS, a proprietary point-of-sale software solution, to a limited number of franchisees in BK and PLK restaurants in the U.S., Mexico and Germany, and we continue to enhance this product and work to expand its adoption. Alternatively, franchisees may utilize point of sale software provided by a set of approved third-party vendors. Depending on the region, these vendors may also provide labor scheduling, inventory, production management, cash control services, and other services. We have an architecture that enables us to build custom customer-facing applications and integrate them with our third-party providers, to support mobile ordering, web ordering, and kiosks. As of the end of 2022, we have deployed this architecture in the U.S., Canada, and several other jurisdictions, and we plan to deploy it to additional markets in the future.
 We expanded our digital technologies and the use of our mobile apps continued to increase. We provide digital loyalty programs across all four brands in our home markets and offer our guests added convenience by offering third party and white label delivery at many of our home market restaurants. Further, we are modernizing the drive-thru experience with outdoor digital menu boards for TH, BK and PLK brands in their home markets. We plan to leverage our technology capabilities to continue to expand the choices for how customers order, pay and receive their food.

 Table of Contents
 Although many of our systems are provided through third parties, we have the ability to obtain data from most of our franchised restaurants and from Company restaurants, which allows us to assess how our new and existing products are performing around the world.  Additionally, we have been investing to upgrade our supply chain systems and improve efficiency. We expect to continue to invest in technology capabilities to support and drive our business.
 Competition
 Each of our brands competes in the U.S., Canada and internationally with many well-established food service companies on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. With few barriers to entry to the restaurant industry, our competitors include a variety of independent local operators, in addition to well-capitalized regional, national and international restaurant chains and franchises, and new competitors may emerge at any time. We also compete for consumer dining dollars with national, regional and local (i) quick service restaurants that offer alternative menus, (ii) casual and “fast casual” restaurant chains (iii) convenience stores and grocery stores, and (iv) new concepts, such as virtual brands and dark kitchens. Furthermore, delivery aggregators and other food delivery services provide consumers with convenient access to a broad range of competing restaurant chains and food retailers, particularly in urban areas.
 Government Regulations and Affairs
 General. We and our franchisees are subject to various laws and regulations including (i) licensing and regulation relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards, sustainability, and, for our distribution business, traffic and transportation regulations; (ii) information security, privacy and consumer protection laws; and (iii) other laws regulating the design, accessibility and operation of facilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and similar Canadian federal and provincial legislation that can have a significant impact on our franchisees and our performance. These regulations include food safety regulations, including supervision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its international equivalents, which govern the manufacture, labeling, packaging and safety of food. In addition, we are or may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat, high-calorie and high-sodium foods, particularly in Canada, the U.S., the United Kingdom and Spain. Certain countries, provinces, states and municipalities have approved menu labeling legislation that requires restaurant chains to provide caloric information on menu boards, and menu labeling legislation has also been adopted on the U.S. federal level as well as in Ontario.
 U.S. and Canada. Our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. We and our franchisees are also subject to various employment laws, including laws governing union organizing, working conditions, work authorization requirements, health insurance, overtime and wages and efforts are currently underway to strengthen these laws in favor of the employee. In addition, we and our U.S. franchisees are subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
 We are subject to federal franchising laws adopted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and state and provincial franchising laws. Much of the legislation and rules adopted have been aimed at providing detailed disclosure to a prospective franchisee, duties of good faith as between the franchisor and the franchisee, and/or periodic registration by the franchisor with applicable regulatory agencies. Additionally, some U.S. states have enacted or are considering enacting legislation that governs the termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement and other aspects of the franchise relationship.
 International. Internationally, we and our franchisees are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar in nature to those affecting us and our franchisees in the U.S. and Canada. We and our franchisees are also subject to a variety of tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment, and laws regulating foreign investment.
 Environmental. Various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and restaurant waste and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations and the operations of our franchisees; however, we do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, or competitive position. Increased focus by U.S., Canadian and international governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. There is a possibility that government initiatives, or actual or perceived effect of changes in weather patterns, climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of our brands in ways that we cannot predict at this time.

 Sustainability
 We are committed to the simple principle of doing what’s right. Our “Restaurant Brands for Good” plan provides a framework for serving our guests the food and drinks they love while contributing to a sustainable future and having a positive social impact in the communities we serve. Our ongoing efforts will focus on three key pillars:
 •Food - serving high quality and great tasting food every day with a focus on food safety, improving choice, nutrition, transparency, and ingredients;
 •Planet - continuing to reduce our environmental footprint, with a focus on packaging and recycling, green buildings, and responsible sourcing; and
 •People & Communities - supporting communities and enhancing livelihoods, with a focus on supporting communities, talent development, diversity and inclusion, ethics and human rights, and improving supplier livelihoods.
 In September 2021, we announced targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, as well as a commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. While most of the impact is from scope 3 emissions that are not under our direct control, reaching these targets will require us to devote resources to support changes by suppliers and franchisees.
 The sustainability section of our corporate website sets forth our initiatives with respect to these pillars and will be updated periodically but is not incorporated into this Annual Report.
 Seasonal Operations
 Our restaurant sales are typically higher in the spring and summer months when the weather is warmer and typically lowest during the winter months. Furthermore, adverse weather conditions can have material adverse effects on restaurant sales. The timing of holidays may also impact restaurant sales. Because our businesses are moderately seasonal, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 6,400 employees, including approximately 2,100 corporate employees in our restaurant support centers and serving our franchisees from the field, approximately 1,100 employees in our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, and approximately 3,200 employees in Company restaurants. Our franchisees are independent business owners that separately employ more than 500,000 team members in their restaurants.
 We strive to create a workplace environment where our employees love coming to work each day; a place that is committed to inclusion, respect, accountability and doing what is right. While our board regularly receives updates from our People team, the compensation committee has oversight of our compensation program and the audit committee has been tasked with oversight of workforce management risks. Our People team is organized into four pillars that focus on attracting, retaining, developing and rewarding top talent.
 The cycle starts with attracting talent from campus and professional sources, leveraging technology to identify and assess candidates who best fit our roles. As part of our hiring process, we have committed that at least half of all final-round candidates interviewing for roles with our four RBI restaurant support centers will be from groups that are demonstrably diverse, including gender, race and sexual orientation, based on the composition and requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. Since our commitment, we have meaningfully exceeded that target, leading to an increase in diverse hires. In 2022, RBI hired approximately 670 new corporate employees, 5,800 new restaurant employees, and 430 new distribution and manufacturing employees. Each population segment has a dedicated onboarding program designed to get employees up to speed quickly, and foster a smooth transition into the workplace.
 The retention efforts focus on work environment, employee engagement and our diversity and inclusion initiatives. We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our restaurant support center employees on a variety of topics, including our sustainability and diversity initiatives, flexible work policies, the support they receive from their managers, and what types of learning and development opportunities they would like to have offered. Our executive Steering Committee monitors progress across key indicators such as representation, engagement, and retention to guide strategies for promoting diversity and inclusion. To ensure that the work of the Steering Committee is fully integrated, we have dedicated team members within the people and legal teams to implement initiatives in this space. These initiatives include company-wide implicit bias training, internal events featuring eminent speakers, sponsorship and mentorship opportunities for identity-based groups. We also leverage designated subject matter experts across each of our brands to ensure accountability and consistent execution of priorities company-wide with regards to marketing, suppliers, franchisees, and community engagement.

 Table of Contents
 Developing talent includes evaluation, training, career planning and leadership development. We have a rigorous talent assessment process for restaurant support center employees built on specific competencies that we assess at both the employee and job level. This data allows us to more easily identify potential successors and illuminate potential opportunities for our employees in a more objective and unbiased way. Additionally, to help our employees and franchisee’s team members succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. In 2022, we conducted management and leadership training, including problem solving, feedback sessions, data analysis and spot learning opportunities to address specific business needs. We also brought back our brand service days, which allow corporate employees to work in our restaurants in a structured way that enables a better link between the corporate strategies we make and the operational deployment of them at the restaurant level. We launched a formal mentoring program in 2022, connecting employees from our restaurant support centers around the world to facilitate career growth and development opportunities.
 Our approach to rewarding talent is through a combination of compensation, recognition, wellness and benefits. We are committed to providing market-competitive pay and benefits, affirming our pay for performance philosophy while balancing retention risk. Restaurant support center and distribution employees are eligible for performance-based cash incentive programs. Each incentive plan reinforces and rewards individuals for achievement of specific business goals. All employees are also able to access telemedicine with no copay, as well as a 24/7 Employee Assistance Program. For corporate office and field-based employees, we offer a leading parental leave policy.
 Underpinning all of these initiatives is a strong reliance on data. We leverage our people analytics team and human capital management system to assess our achievements in each of our four pillars to identify areas for improvement. A team of experienced People Business Partners work closely with their client groups to provide counsel on people issues and help roll out people initiatives directly to employees.
 While much of the work mentioned above relates to our corporate workforce, we also have adopted employee guidelines and policies applicable to our restaurant employees and encourage our franchisees to adopt similar guidelines and policies.
 Philanthropic Foundations
 RBI is committed to strengthening and giving back to the communities we serve through our brand foundations and by supporting local programs and issues that are close to our guests’ hearts. To date, our philanthropic foundations include:
 The Burger King Foundation: Established in 2005, the Burger King Foundation creates brighter futures by empowering individuals and feeding potential through education and emergency relief. As of December 31, 2022, the Burger King Foundation is active in 42 countries around the world. Since its inception, over 250,000 children and families have been supported through educational programs and employee emergency relief grants, with the Burger King Scholars Program awarding over $55 million in scholarship funds alone.
 Tim Hortons Foundation Camps and Smile Cookie Initiative: Created in 1974, Tim Hortons Foundation Camps are helping youth aged 12-16 from disadvantaged circumstances discover the strengths within themselves. Through December 31, 2022, the Tim Hortons Foundation’s annual Camp Day has raised over C$237 million and has sent more than 300,000 youth to a multi-year camp-based program at one of seven Tims Camps in Canada and the United States. In addition, Tim Hortons’ annual Smile Cookie initiative is empowering restaurant owners to sell special Smile Cookies for a full week and donate 100% of the proceeds. Since the first-ever Smile Cookie campaign in 1996, this charitable campaign has raised more than C$92 million for local charities, hospitals, and community programs.
 The Popeyes Foundation: The mission of the Popeyes Foundation is to strengthen communities with food and support in times of need. The Popeyes Foundation contributes to communities through third-party initiatives and has provided $1.7 million and over 4 million meals to children in local communities since 2018. The Foundation additionally supports the Popeyes family directly through the Popeyes Foundation Family Fund. This fund supports U.S. employees who may be victims of natural disasters or other emergency hardship situations. Since 2017 through December 31, 2022, 530 Popeyes team members have been helped through close to $500,000 in grants through the fund.
 Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation: Firehouse Subs was founded by two brothers and former firefighters in 1994 and was built on a passion for hearty and flavorful food, heartfelt service, and public safety. In 2005, the Firehouse Subs founders established the non-profit Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Since that day through December 31, 2022, a portion of every purchase goes to the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation which has granted $73 million to provide lifesaving equipment, training, and support to first responders and public safety organizations.
