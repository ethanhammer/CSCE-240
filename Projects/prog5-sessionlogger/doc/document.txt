The goal of this assignment was to create a statistics tracker that analyzed output from our previous major project.

To do this, I began by modifying prog4 to create complete logs. It recorded every interaction and

kept track of how many times both the user and bot spoke as well as how many seconds it was open for.

Whenever the user would close the program, it would add the recorded stats to the end of the log file.

I then created the prog 5 project and put three of such files into the data folder and in a sub-folder named chat-sessions. 

The project itself is sorted into front end and back end classes. 

The front end gathers userinput and filters it whereas the back end parses the files.

The front end owns an instance  of the backend class. When the backend is created, 

it also creates a chat_statistics.csv file using methods to parse the file.

 Once a user enters a command, the command is sorted and the back end is called to fulfil that respective command.

The search commands function by going through a respective file and looking for key words like Time Taken:.

The do functions work by navigating to the nth file and either looking for all the different search commands or 

printing the actual file. The -summary command does everything and totals all of the search function results for every file.
